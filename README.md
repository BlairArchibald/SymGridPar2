SymGridPar2
===========

SymGridPar2 is a library which supports parallel and distributed coordination of
computer algebra systems using the HdpH framework [1,2]. SymGridPar2 is described
in detail in [3].

At the moment this version of the library only supports a binding to the GAP [4]
computer algebra system.
